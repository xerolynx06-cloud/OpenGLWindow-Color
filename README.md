 # Some Info
 - We can Add Many Colours
 - R = Red , G = Green , B = Blue , A = Alpha (Opacity)
 - For Blue = (0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)
 - For Red = (1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)
 - For Green = (0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)
 - For White = (1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)
 - For Black = (0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)
 - Just Substitute the float points in glClearColor
 - There Are Many Colors , These Are Primary
